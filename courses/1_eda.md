The journey from raw data to actionable insights is often paved with challenges and uncertainties. 
At the heart of this journey lies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, a foundational process that 
serves as a compass, guiding data scientists through the intricate landscape of their datasets. 

EDA is not merely a preliminary step; it is a profound exploration that unlocks the hidden treasures 
buried within data, revealing patterns, anomalies, and relationships that form the bedrock of informed 
decision-making. 

## What is EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an analytical approach aimed at uncovering the inherent characteristics 
of datasets, utilizing statistical and visualization techniques.

Unlike hypothesis-driven analyses driven by prior domain knowledge, EDA is a flexible, open-ended exploration 
that allows data scientists to delve into the data without preconceived notions. Essentially, EDA serves as a 
preliminary step to inspire hypothesis generation by unveiling intriguing patterns, trends, and correlations 
within the data. 

## Key Components of EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) typically consists of several key components or stages that guide data scientists 
through the process of understanding and exploring a dataset. These components can vary depending on the specific 
goals of the analysis and the characteristics of the data, but commonly include:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
3. **Descriptive Statistics**
4. **Univariate Analysis**
5. **Bivariate Analysis**
6. **Multivariate Analysis**
7. **Feature Engineering**
8. **Visualization**
