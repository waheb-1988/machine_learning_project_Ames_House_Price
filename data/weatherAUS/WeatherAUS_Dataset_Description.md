# Machine Learning Project: Weather Models for Rain Prediction in Australia

## Overview  
This project involves analyzing and building machine learning models using the Weather Models for Rain Prediction in Australia Data Set. This dataset contains detailed meteorological information recorded in Albury, Australia, for a specific period. It includes 24 attributes for each day, capturing various aspects of the weather.

## Project Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's features and distributions.
- Build predictive models to estimate house sale prices using machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate and compare model performance using classification metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC..
- Derive actionable insights to help real estate professionals make data-driven decisions.
