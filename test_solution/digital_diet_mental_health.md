# Exercise Announcement: Impact of Screen Time on Mental Health

Explore the relationship between screen time and mental health. Your goal is to understand
the structure of the dataset, perform analysis, build predictive models, and interpret the
results. You need treat the mental_health_score either as a continuous variable (regression)
or convert it into a binary classification target:


## Steps : 
1. Load the Data
2. Analyze the Structure of the Data
3. Univariate Analysis
4. Multivariate Analysis
5. Feature Engineering
6. Modeling Try multiple models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN,SVM).
7. Hyperparameter Tuning
8. Results Interpretation

## Project Objectives  
Evaluation will prioritize your Python code structure, especially your ability to:
- Create and organize your solution using classes and methods.
- Write clean, reusable, and modular code.
- Work independently without the use of any AI code assistant or agent.
- Dead line : 17/05/2025 Before 5 Pm
