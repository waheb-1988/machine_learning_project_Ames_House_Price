# Logistic Regression Teaching Plan

This teaching plan is designed to guide students through the process of understanding and implementing Logistic Regression. It covers essential data science steps, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, modeling, and result interpretation.

## 1. Introduction to Logistic Regression  
### Objective  
Introduce Logistic Regression and its role in classification problems.  

### Activities  
- Define Logistic Regression and explain its purpose.  
- Discuss real-world applications (e.g., spam detection, disease prediction).  
- Compare Logistic Regression with Linear Regression and highlight key differences.  

---

## 2. Understanding the Dataset  
### Objective  
Explore the dataset and define the classification task.  

### Activities  
- Load and inspect the dataset using `pandas`.  
- Identify key features and the target variable.  
- Explore data types (numerical, categorical) and basic statistics using `.describe()` and `.info()`.  

---

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
### Objective  
Analyze data distribution and relationships between variables.  

### Activities  
- **Univariate Analysis**:  
  - Plot distributions for numerical features using `seaborn.histplot()`.  
  - Count plots for categorical features.  
- **Multivariate Analysis**:  
  - Scatter plots for feature relationships.  
  - Compute and visualize the correlation matrix using `sns.heatmap()`.

## 4. Data Preprocessing  
### Objective  
Prepare the data for Logistic Regression modeling.  

### Activities  
- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.  
- Encode categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies()` or `OneHotEncoder()`.  
- Scale numerical features using `StandardScaler()` or `MinMaxScaler()`.  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.

## 5. Logistic Regression Model  
### Objective  
Train a Logistic Regression model to classify data.  

### Activities  
- Train a Logistic Regression model using `LogisticRegression()` from `scikit-learn`.  
- Understand the role of the sigmoid function in probability estimation.  
- Explain odds, log-odds, and decision boundaries.  

---

## 6. Model Evaluation  
### Objective  
Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.  

### Activities  
- Compute evaluation metrics:  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score using `classification_report()`.  
  - Confusion Matrix using `confusion_matrix()`.  
  - ROC-AUC Curve using `roc_curve()` and `auc()`.  
- Interpret results and discuss improvements.  

---

## 7. Optimization Techniques  
### Objective  
Improve model performance through optimization techniques.  

### Activities  
- Discuss feature selection to reduce overfitting.  
- Regularization techniques (L1 and L2) using `LogisticRegression(penalty='l1' or 'l2')`.  
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search (`GridSearchCV`).  

---

## 8. Conclusion and Next Steps  
### Objective  
Summarize key learnings and suggest further exploration.  

### Activities  
- Recap Logistic Regression concepts and best practices.  
- Discuss limitations and when to use alternative models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVMs).  
- Encourage hands-on practice with different datasets.
