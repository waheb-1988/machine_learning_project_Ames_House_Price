# Ames Housing Dataset First TP : Linear Regression  

This teaching plan is designed to guide students through the process of building a Linear Regression model using the Ames Housing dataset. It covers essential data science steps, including EDA, data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and result interpretation.

---

## 1. Dataset Overview  
### Objective  
Introduce the Ames Housing dataset and its relevance in predicting house prices.  

### Activities  
- Discuss the context: Predicting house prices using various features.  
- Load and inspect the dataset using `pandas`.  
- Highlight key features: `SalePrice` (target), `GrLivArea`, `OverallQual`, etc.  
- Explore data types (numerical, categorical) and basic statistics using `.describe()` and `.info()`.  

---

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
### Objective  
Understand data distribution and relationships between variables.  

### Activities  
- **Univariate Analysis**:  
  - Distribution plots for numerical variables using `seaborn.histplot()` or `sns.boxplot()`.  
  - Count plots for categorical variables (e.g., `Neighborhood`, `OverallQual`).  
- **Multivariate Analysis**:  
  - Scatter plots (e.g., `GrLivArea` vs. `SalePrice`).  
  - Pairplots for important features.  
- **Correlation Matrix**:  
  - Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix using `sns.heatmap()`.  
  - Identify highly correlated features with `SalePrice`.

## 2. Data Cleaning  
### Objective  
Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for modeling.  

### Activities  
- Check for missing values using `.isnull().sum()` and visualize them with `sns.heatmap()`.  
- Handle missing values:  
  - Drop columns with too many missing values.  
  - Impute numerical columns with mean/median and categorical columns with mode.  
  - Use domain knowledge for specific columns (e.g., `LotFrontage`).  
- Address outliers identified during EDA.  


---

## 3. Data Preprocessing  
### Objective  
Prepare the data for modeling.  

### Activities  
- Encode categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies()` or `OneHotEncoder()`.  
- Feature engineering:  
  - Create new features (e.g., `TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF`).  
    


---

## 4. Split Data  
### Objective  
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  

### Activities  
- Use `train_test_split()` from `scikit-learn` to split the data (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).  
- Discuss the importance of splitting data for unbiased model evaluation.  

---

## 5. Scaling  
### Objective  
Standardize numerical features for better model performance.  

### Activities  
- Apply `StandardScaler()` or `MinMaxScaler()` to numerical features.  
- Discuss when and why scaling is necessary (e.g., for models sensitive to feature magnitude).  

---

## 6. Linear Regression  
### Objective  
Train a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.  

### Activities  
- Train a Linear Regression model using `LinearRegression()` from `scikit-learn`.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as `MAE`, `MSE`, and `R2 Score`.  
- Visualize residuals to check model assumptions.  

  

---

## 7. Interpretation of Results  
### Objective  
Interpret and communicate model results.  

### Activities  
- Explain model coefficients and their impact on `SalePrice`.  
- Discuss overfitting and underfitting using training and testing performance.  
- Suggest next steps (e.g., trying other models like Ridge, Lasso, or Tree-based models).
